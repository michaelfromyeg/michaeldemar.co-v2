            <p>For CSLC 2018, I was the director of student programming. My primary responsibility was to oversee the development of program components across the five day conference. I also worked to solidify the conference values, trying the program components together and leaving delegates with a unified message. I had to maintain both vertical and horizontal communication; that is, both within the five collaborating high schools and between them. The task was easily my most difficult and rewarding leadership role, and I am grateful to have been able to impact the delegates who came.

          <h6>CAPABLE GRAPHIC DESIGNER THAT LEARNED BY DOING.</h6>
          <ul class="resume">

            <li>
            <span>Freelance</span>
            <p>First became interested in graphic design after taking a mix of visual communications and coding classes in junior high, working with Photoshop and Illustrator to create simple projects. In high school, I found infinite room to play, design, and flourish as a designer. I created: advertisements for our school’s Pancake Breakfast, branding for our Bike-a-Thon, Junior High Leadership Conference (in which I worked with Karen Schiltz, graphic designer for Classic Landscapes), Heritage Festival, and for my initiatives, such as our Book Club, our volunteering club, MASSIVE, and my personal website. I even got approached by our school’s media team to create a logo, which is now used by our photograph teacher as an email signature.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
            <span>Client</span>
            <p>Assisted with branding for Canadian Student Leadership Conference (CSLC) 2018. I worked with a talented graphic designer contracted by Harry Ainlay who walked me through the design process. He worked with my logo designs when eventually drafting our final conference branding. For Student Senate, I was a member of the ‘Time Management’ committee, whose primary focus was creating a resource for students to combat procrastination, for which we decided brochures were best suited. I took on the responsbility of designing the brochures. I used Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign to create them. Operating under certain constraints, such as a maximum of three colors, and an amount of content to fit, the brochures were complete. We printed off 600 copies for each school in EPSB. This year, I created the playbill for our school's mainstage production, and am currently working on creating the program for our graduation ceremony.</p>
