<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>My name is Michael,</strong> and I'm a 17 year-old aspiring computer scientist and jack-of-all something. I'm passionate about solving problems, large or small, software or otherwise.</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>I'm about to begin studying at the University of British Columbia</strong> this fall. I was born and raised in Edmonton, and will be moving to Vancouver in late August of 2019.</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>I've loved working with technology</strong> since a young age. Since starting out on Lego Mindstorms many years ago, I've since worked with web development frameworks like Flask, created apps in Java, and dabbled in competitive programming. My project work is available on my Github page.</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>I'm a passionate communicator.</strong> You can check out my blog for some miscellanious thoughts on what's happening in our world today. I also do a fair amount of public speaking. Some of it's on my YouTube channel, with more to come in the near future!</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>I'm no artist, but</strong> I'm crazy about graphic design. You can check out some of my favourite pieces I've made on my Behance profile. Looking to have some work done? Get in touch at me@michaeldemar.co.</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>I love to teach.</strong> I'm an experienced tutor, instructing everything from programming to English as a Second Language and everything in between. Know someone looking for a tutor or need one yourself? Learn more here.</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>I get involved.</strong> From non-for-profits to initiatives I've founded, I've worked to create a ripple on a number of issues important to me while growing as a leader meanwhile. Learn more.</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px;"><strong>And I want to get to know you!</strong> Reach out on any of the social links on this page. I don't bite!</p>
