<h1 class="title">About me</h1>

<p>Hi! I’m Michael. Welcome to my site. Here’s a little about me.</p>

<p>
    I’m a 17 year-old university student attending the University of British
    Columbia. I plan to pursue studies in computing science. I previously
    attended McNally High School, Ottewell Junior High, and, a number of moons
    ago Clara Tyner Elementary. Throughout school I’ve strived to find the
    balance between applying myself academically and being an active citizen in
    my community.
</p>

<p>
    That’s led to some pretty neat results. I’ve had the privilege of leading a
    nationwide leadership conference, representing youth on both Edmonton’s
    Youth Council and the public school district’s Student Senate, and
    volunteering with a not-for-profit summer camp in a variety of roles. When
    I’m not busy performing the juggling act that is my life, I enjoy making
    music with either a saxophone or piano, kicking a soccer ball around, or
    reading.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of the day, my goal is to make an impact on the world. For the
    longest time I was convinced I would do that as a lawyer. Eventually (and
    almost overnight) I changed paths and am now pursuing computing science. I
    want to be a part of developing the technology required to fix our shaky
    planet. Climate change, public discourse, and access to technology are just
    some of the issues I hope to tackle as best I can behind a mouse and
    keyboard.
</p>

<p>
    So that was a bit about me. Now, I’d love to hear your story! Get in touch
    at me@michaeldemar.co.
